6:T427,During the COVID lockdowns I got heavily interested in ecommerce and advertising on the internet. In doing so I researched and consumed any information I could get my hands on that could ultimately make me more sales. This lead me to reading books about consumer psychology, marketing and copywriting. Ogilvy on advertising was one of my two favorites of the books that I read during this period.

In this book David Ogilvy - known as 'The Father of Advertising' - speaks about all things advertising in the twentieth century. Mostly he speaks about advertising in newspapers during the 1950s and 1960s, but information is the information in this book is both timeless and priceless. He details methods of gaining and maintaining a potential customers interest in an advertisement and the common pitfalls of inexperience in marketing. Ogilvy is thoroughly practical and dismisses the common thought process of supposed 'good advertising' and committed his philosophy to what measurably worked.

This was a very interesting book and would recommend it to anyone.

7:T4b1,Love him or hate him, Elon Musk is one of the most interesting people of our time. I read this book at the same time I was reading Steve Jobs biography, and saw a lot of similarities in both men. They are both highly successful but also very cruel people in their own way. To be honest I wasn't very interested in Musk's personal life or his opinions, and rather focused on his corporate life and how he operated on a professional level.

There are many anecdotes in this book that are representative of what made Musk such a success in many different fields. He is a man that has high agency in his own life, and takes huge risks. The high agency element of his character permeates Tesla, as Steve Jobs' passion for design imbues Apple to this day. While working on the starship in the Nevada desert for example, Tesla employees were breeding dragon flies in paddling pools to counteract the amount of mosquitoes that were in the desert. Another aspect of Musk's character that is similar to that of Jobs is his ability to ignore the notion of impossibility. Both men thought of what they wanted to be possible, and worried about engineering scruples after the fact, which proved to be huge for both.8:T400,When I was 18 I started getting into philosophy, and more particularly reading about German philosophers such as Nietzsche, Hegel and Schopenhauer. While browsing on YouTube I would listen to lectures and videos about philosophy and enjoyed the depth of but also the courage of thought of these philosophers.

Although I'm no philosopher myself, I have read the guts of Beyond Good and Evil by Nietzsche, and have to say that it is definitely the most unique book that I have ever opened. It is one of those books that you have to read for yourself, and with Beyond Good and Evil, you will find yourself reading, and rereading over and over again. I once heard somewhere that 'every sentence in Beyond Good and Evil is like a bomb' - and this is the closest description that I have seen to the experience of reading the pages of this book. It is a critique of 1800s western culture, and is an attack on "dogma". I'm going to leave my description at that because this is one of those books you just have to read for yourself.0:{"P":null,"b":"YqfOM7sur19j20UwjoOBn","p":"","c":["","bookshelf"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["bookshelf",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/07c5c498d6458c95.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","link","1",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/83197ee06dc5ff20.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","link","2",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/a81a98d3187ca5ec.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","className":"__className_3a0388","children":["$","body",null,{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{"links":[{"text":"Home","href":"/"},{"text":"Product Mockups","href":"/product"},{"text":"Linux Kernel Projects","href":"/linux-kernel-projects"},{"text":"Other Software Projects","href":"/other-software-projects"},{"text":"Content Creation","href":"/content-creation"},{"text":"About Me","href":"/about-me"},{"text":"Bookshelf","href":"/bookshelf"}]}],["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}],["$","footer",null,{"className":"large-separator medium-bottom-separator medium-padding-x","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"footer-main","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Let's Work Together"}],["$","h3",null,{"id":"email-address","className":"__className_c1e5c9","style":{"fontWeight":300},"children":"mikeyp.fennelly@gmail.com"}]]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"small-padding-bottom","children":[["$","$L5",null,{"href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikeyfennelly/","target":"_blank","className":"link-text-separation","children":"LinkedIn"}],["$","$L5",null,{"href":"https://github.com/mikeyfennelly1","target":"_blank","className":"link-text-separation","children":"GitHub"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"medium-separator light-border-top","children":["$","p",null,{"className":"small-separator","children":"An eefenn website."}]}]]}]]}]}]]}],{"children":["bookshelf",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","section","0.8943821946652624",{"children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":["Steve Jobs",["$","span",null,{"style":{"fontWeight":200},"children":[" - ","Walter Isaacson"]}]]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"In January 2024 my uncle went to California for the 40th anniversary of the original Macintosh.
